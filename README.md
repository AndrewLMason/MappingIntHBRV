# MappingIntHBRV #
In vivo and in vitro mapping of HBRV integrations on the human genome<br><br>

A series of integration sites of HBRV along the human genome were determined experimentally, in vitro and in vivo, using LM-PCR. To test a hypothesis of randon distribution of integrations in the genome, the same number of integrations were simulated according to a random distribution. The integration frecuency at discrete distances from the closest transcriptional start site (TSS) or from the closest CpG Island was determined and compared against the frequency of experimental integrations. <br>
